    <p>The Atlas of the Old World is a fan project dedicated to mapping the world of Warhammer Fantasy. This project attempts to create, as much as is possible, an accurate and consistent representation of the Warhammer world, with gaps in the lore generously filled with my own interpretations or the interpretations of others in the community. No AI is used in any part of the creative process; topographic maps, rivers, settlement names and positions are all hand-drawn/-written/-placed. The front-end Javascript used for displaying the project in the form of a webpage was assisted in part by AI.</p>
    
    <h2>Credit and Thanks</h2>
    
    <p>This project would never have been possible without the tremendous creative and technical efforts of others. Enormous credit goes to <b>Andy Law</b> (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/LAWhammer/">check out his Patreon!</a>) for his decades of work mapping the Old World, and in particular his detailed maps of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/reikland-sketch-97801192">the Reikland</a>, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/middenland-124647044">Middenland</a>, and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/middenheim-142180395">Middenheim</a>, among others. His work has been an invaluable, and in many parts direct, resource for this project.</p>

    <p>Similarly I would extend my appreciation and credit to Alfred Nuñez Jr. aka <a href="https://www.madalfred.com/">MadAlfred</a> for his contributions to the Warhammer world via maps, gazetteers, and personal projects. Thanks also to Clay deGruchy for providing inspiration and guidance to start this project based on his <a href="https://claydegruchy.github.io/wfrp-map-osm/">amazing work</a>, <a href="http://www.gitzmansgallery.com/">Gitzman's Gallery</a> for being an invaluable cartographic resource, as well as Emile Beguin, MapyNiepraktyczne/Impractical Cartographer, and the many members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/6saHAcZMMH">Rat Catchers Guild</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/ghn6MzSy9M">LAWhammer</a> Discord communities.</p>
    
    Please note that there are conflicting and inconsistent sources for the locations and populations of many sites in the Warhammer world. The following 'canonicity tier list' was approximately used to prioritize sources when discrepancies arose. This is a personal choice and may differ from other interpretations:
    <ol>
        <li>Recent Games Workshop publications (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4e, Warhammer:The Old World material)</li>
        <li>Maps and gazetteers by Andy Law, both published (WFRP 2e) and unpublished, leaning on the extraordinary work of Andy and Lindsay Law in collating decades of lore references for their maps</li>
        <li>Older Games Workshop publications (WFRP 1e, WFB army books pre-8th edition)</li>
        <li>Other fan interpretations and resources (MadAlfred, community maps, etc.)</li>
    </ol>
