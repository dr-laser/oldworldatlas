    <p>The Atlas of the Old World is a fan project dedicated to mapping the world of Warhammer Fantasy. This project attempts to create, as much as is possible, an accurate and consistent representation of the Warhammer world, with gaps in the lore generously filled with my own interpretations or the interpretations of others in the community. No AI is used in any part of the creative process; topographic maps, rivers, settlement names and positions are all hand-drawn/-written/-placed. The front-end Javascript used for displaying the project in the form of a webpage was assisted in part by AI.</p>
    
    <h2>Credit and Thanks</h2>



    <p>This project would never have been possible without the tremendous creative and technical efforts of others. Enormous credit goes to <b>Andy Law</b> for his decades of work mapping the Old World.

    Please note that there are conflicting and inconsistent sources for the locations and populations of many sites in the Warhammer world. The following 'canonicity tier list' was approximately used to prioritize sources when discrepancies arose. This is a personal choice and may differ from other interpretations, or be applied inconsistently in some cases:
    <ol>
        <li>Recent Games Workshop publications (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4e, Warhammer:The Old World material)</li>
        <li>Maps and gazetteers by Andy Law, both published (WFRP 2e) and unpublished, leaning on the extraordinary work of Andy and Lindsay Law in collating decades of lore references for their maps</li>
        <li>Older Games Workshop publications (WFRP 1e, WFB army books pre-8th edition)</li>
        <li>Other fan interpretations and resources (MadAlfred, community maps, etc.)</li>
    </ol>
