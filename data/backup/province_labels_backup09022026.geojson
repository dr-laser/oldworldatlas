It lies at the far north-eastern corner of the Empire. Though Ostermark existed at the time the Empire was founded by Sigmar, the League of Ostermark itself was formed out of the chaos of the late 19th century IC during the Age of Three Emperors, when its former capital of Mordheim was struck by a comet of tremendous size. The resulting destruction of the province's central government and the death of its ruling family led the remaining towns and villages of the lands of Ostermark to band together and form a new, oligarchic government which would later become known as the League of Ostermark."
