# Feeding an Empire
## Diet of the Empire
The Diet of an Imperial citizen is varied, both by economic means and by locality. Owing to the difficulty and expense of importing food hundreds of leagues across the Empire, most common folk consume a diet which can be locally sourced. Some commonalities exist, in particular the ubiquity of staple cereals (rye, wheat and barley), both as food in the form of bread, porridge, and stews, and as a beverage in the form of ale and beer. This is supplemented by locally grown fruits and vegetables, cheeses, and meats - especially pork and poultry.

### Ale / Beer
Ale is brewed from barley, wheat, and yeast, while beer includes hops. Both are consumed ubiquitously across the Empire. In addition to being a source of valuable calories for the working poor that make up the majority of the population, the brewing process keeps waterborne ailments at bay. Most large towns will have a local brewery, so the flavour will vary from place to place as the quality and character of the ingredients changes. Beverages brewed and consumed by Dwarfs tends to be of a much stronger character. Beer using hops improves its longevity and allows for the export of beer as a commercial trade good from the larger breweries.

### Fish
The rivers of the Empire provide not only a convenient route for trade and travel, but a veritable bounty for fishermen. Every navigable river in the Empire is lined with small fishing villages which eke out an existence on the day’s catch. In addition to the typical trout, perch, and catfish, the rivers of the Empire are home to freshwater giants like the Reik Eel (a delicacy in Altdorf) and the Stirpike. Off the Empire’s northern coast, especially in Nordland, fleets of fishing boats strike out into the deep, frigid waters of the Sea of Claws and return with cod, herring, lobsters and crabs (if they return at all). These sea fishermen preserve most of their catch by curing them in barrels of salt while still at sea. The rest is sold fresh at market.

### Meats
While daily consumption is typically reserved for the middle and upper classes, meat is common throughout the Empire. Pork, mutton, and poultry - requiring relatively little land to cultivate - are a staple feature at daily markets, either whole or prepared by a local butcher. Beef is rather expensive, typically reserved for special occasions. Meat is prepared in a wide number of ways that vary from region to region, but includes: baked into pies, as a thick stew, salted and cured, or cooked plain.
