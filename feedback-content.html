    Please note that there are conflicting and inconsistent sources for the locations and populations of many sites in the Warhammer world. The following 'canonicity tier list' was used to prioritize sources when discrepancies arose. This is a personal choice and may differ from other interpretations:
    <ol>
        <li>Recent Games Workshop publications (e.g., Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4e, The Old World material)</li>
        <li>Maps and gazetteers by Andy Law, both published (WFRP 2e) and unpublished</li>
        <li>Older Games Workshop publications (e.g. WFRP 1e, army books pre-8th edition)</li>
        <li>Other fan interpretations and resources (MadAlfred, community maps, etc.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What to Report</h2>
    
    <p>We appreciate reports on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing settlements or points of interest</li>
        <li>Inaccurate placement of settlements</li>
        <li>Technical issues or bugs with the map interface</li>
        <li>Suggestions for new features or improvements</li>
    </ul>
    Although not required, providing a specific lore source when reporting inaccuracies is helpful and will improve the project's accuracy and consistency.
    
    <p><em>Thank you for your support!</em></p>
